	abstract = {As vertebrate carrion decomposes, there is a release of nutrient-rich fluids into the underlying soil, which can impact associated biological community structure and function. How these changes alter soil biogeochemical cycles is relatively unknown and may prove useful in the identification of carrion decomposition islands that have long lasting, focal ecological effects. This study investigated the spatial (0, 1, and 5 m) and temporal (3-732 days) dynamics of human cadaver decomposition on soil bacterial and arthropod community structure and microbial function. We observed strong evidence of a predictable response to cadaver decomposition that varies over space for soil bacterial and arthropod community structure, carbon (C) mineralization and microbial substrate utilization patterns. In the presence of a cadaver (i.e., 0 m samples), the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes was greater, while the relative abundance of Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, Gemmatimonadetes, and Verrucomicrobia was lower when compared to samples at 1 and 5 m. Micro-arthropods were more abundant (15 to 17-fold) in soils collected at 0 m compared to either 1 or 5 m, but overall, micro-arthropod community composition was unrelated to either bacterial community composition or function. Bacterial community structure and microbial function also exhibited temporal relationships, whereas arthropod community structure did not. Cumulative precipitation was more effective in predicting temporal variations in bacterial abundance and microbial activity than accumulated degree days. In the presence of the cadaver (i.e., 0 m samples), the relative abundance of Actinobacteria increased significantly with cumulative precipitation. Furthermore, soil bacterial communities and C mineralization were sensitive to the introduction of human cadavers as they diverged from baseline levels and did not recover completely in approximately 2 years. These data are valuable for understanding ecosystem function surrounding carrion decomposition islands and can be applicable to environmental bio-monitoring and forensic sciences.},

Here we combine deep microbial community characterization, community-level metabolic reconstruction, and soil biogeochemical assessment to understand the principles governing microbial community assembly during decomposition of mouse and human corpses on different soil substrates. We find a suite of bacterial and fungal groups that contribute to nitrogen cycling and a reproducible network of decomposers that emerge on predictable time scales. Our results show that this decomposer community is derived primarily from bulk soil, but key decomposers are ubiquitous in low abundance. Soil type was not a dominant factor driving community development, and the process of decomposition is sufficiently reproducible to offer new opportunities for forensic investigations.},

	abstract = {Decomposing animals alter soil biogeochemical cycles, and these natural ephemeral nutrient patches (or 'hot spots') are important for maintaining landscape heterogeneity and enriching local biodiversity. Soil nitrogen (N) enrichment associated with decomposing animals has been documented, but to date an integrated systems-level understanding of the fate and rates of N compound transformations is lacking. The goal of this study was to develop a comprehensive view of temporal changes in N biogeochemical cycling during vertebrate decay. Vertebrate decomposition significantly altered soil N cycling, and was divided into three main biogeochemical phases based on soil chemistry. Phase one included initial and early decay, distinguished by oxic soils with low, background carbon and N cycling rates. Fluid release and insect colonization during active and advanced decay, defined as phase two, stimulated soil microbial communities, particularly those able to degrade phospholipids and nucleic acids. This resulted in anaerobic soils, 250 times greater ammonium and ten times greater carbon dioxide than background, and the highest N-15-enrichment rates. The final biogeochemical phase, encompassing the early and late skeletal stages, was characterized by enhanced nitrification and denitrification as evidenced by significantly elevated nitrate, dissolved organic nitrogen, and enhanced nitrous oxide release. As a result of decay and multiple synchronous processes, soil delta N-15 was enriched by 6-10 parts per thousand above background, demonstrating the influence of decay on soil isotopic signatures. This work provides a systems-level synthesis of N redistribution during animal decay and has significant implications for our understanding of nutrient turnover rates and dynamics in terrestrial ecosystems.},

	abstract = {The thanatomicrobiome (thanatos, Greek for death) is a relatively new term and is the study of the microbes colonizing the internal organs and orifices after death. Recent scientific breakthroughs in an initial study of the thanatomicrobiome have revealed that a majority of the microbes within the human body are the obligate anaerobes, Clostridium spp., in the internal postmortem microbial communities. We hypothesized that time-dependent changes in the thanatomicrobiome within internal organs can estimate the time of death as a human body decays. Here we report a cross-sectional study of the sampling of 27 human corpses from criminal cases with postmortem intervals between 3.5-240 hours. The impetus for examining microbial communities in different internal organs is to address the paucity of empirical data on thanatomicrobiomic succession caused by the limited access to these organs prior to death and a dearth of knowledge regarding the movement of microbes within remains. Our sequencing results of 16S rRNA gene amplicons of 27 postmortem samples from cadavers demonstrated statistically significant time-, organ-, and sex-dependent changes. These results suggest that comprehensive knowledge of the number and abundance of each organ's signature microorganisms could be useful to forensic microbiologists as a new source of data for estimating postmortem interval.},

The objective of our study was to document postmortem changes in human gut bacterial communities. Gut microflora were repeatedly sampled from the caeca of cadavers as they decayed under natural environmental conditions. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing revealed that over time, bacterial richness significantly increased (rs = 0.449) while diversity decreased (rs = - 0.701). The composition of gut bacterial communities changed in a similar manner over time towards a common decay community. OTUs belonging to Bacteroidales (Bacteroides, Parabacteroides) significantly declined while Clostridiales (Clostridium, Anaerosphaera) and the fly-associated Gammaproteobacteria Ignatzschineria and Wohlfahrtiimonas increased.

Results indicated that partially skeletonized remains maintained a presence of bacteria associated with the human gut, whereas bacterial composition of dry skeletal remains maintained a community profile similar to soil communities. Variation in the UniFrac distances was significantly greater between groups than within groups (p {\textless} 0.001) for the unweighted metric and not the weighted metric. The members of the bacterial communities were more similar within than between decomposition stages. The oligotrophic environment of bone relative to soft tissue and the physical protection of organic substrates may preclude bacterial blooms during the first years of skeletonization. Therefore, community membership (unweighted) may be better for estimating PMI from skeletonized remains than community structure (weighted).},

We collected soils from beneath four cadavers throughout decomposition, and analyzed soil chemistry, microbial activity and bacterial community structure. As expected, decomposition resulted in pulses of soil C and nutrients (particularly ammonia) and stimulated microbial activity. There was no change in total bacterial abundances, however we observed distinct changes in both function and community composition. During active decay (7 - 12 days postmortem), respiration and biomass production rates were high: the community was dominated by Proteobacteria (increased from 15.0 to 26.1\% relative abundance) and Firmicutes (increased from 1.0 to 29.0\%), with reduced Acidobacteria abundances (decreased from 30.4 to 9.8\%). Once decay rates slowed (10 - 23 d postmortem), respiration was elevated, but biomass production rates dropped dramatically; this community with low growth efficiency was dominated by Firmicutes (increased to 50.9\%) and other anaerobic taxa. Human-associated bacteria, including the obligately anaerobic Bacteroides, were detected at high concentrations in soil throughout decomposition, up to 198 d postmortem. Our results revealed the pattern of functional and compositional succession in soil microbial communities during decomposition of human-derived organic matter, provided insight into decomposition processes, and identified putative predictor populations for time since death estimation.},

	abstract = {The ecology of soils associated with dead mammals (i.e. cadavers) is poorly understood. Although temperature and soil type are well known to influence the decomposition of other organic resource patches, the effect of these variables on the degradation of cadavers in soil has received little experimental investigation. To address this, cadavers of juvenile rats (Rattus rattus) were buried in one of three contrasting soils (Sodosol, Rudosol, and Vertosol) from tropical savanna ecosystems in Queensland, Australia and incubated at 29 degrees C, 22 degrees C, or 15 degrees C in a laboratory setting. Cadavers and soils were destructively sampled at intervals of 7 days over an incubation period of 28 days. Measurements of decomposition included cadaver mass loss, carbon dioxide-carbon (CO2-C) evolution, microbial biomass carbon (MBC), protease activity, phosphodiesterase activity, and soil pH, which were all significantly positively affected by cadaver burial. A temperature effect was observed where peaks or differences in decomposition that at occurred at higher temperature would occur at later sample periods at lower temperature. Soil type also had an important effect on some measured parameters. These findings have important implications for a largely unexplored area of soil ecology and nutrient cycling, which are significant for forensic science, cemetery planning and livestock carcass disposal.

	abstract = {A dead mammal (i.e. cadaver) is a high quality resource (narrow carbon:nitrogen ratio, high water content) that releases an intense, localised pulse of carbon and nutrients into the soil upon decomposition. Despite the fact that as much as 5,000 kg of cadaver can be introduced to a square kilometre of terrestrial ecosystem each year, cadaver decomposition remains a neglected microsere. Here we review the processes associated with the introduction of cadaver-derived carbon and nutrients into soil from forensic and ecological settings to show that cadaver decomposition can have a greater, albeit localised, effect on belowground ecology than plant and faecal resources. Cadaveric materials are rapidly introduced to belowground floral and faunal communities, which results in the formation of a highly concentrated island of fertility, or cadaver decomposition island (CDI). CDIs are associated with increased soil microbial biomass, microbial activity (C mineralisation) and nematode abundance. Each CDI is an ephemeral natural disturbance that, in addition to releasing energy and nutrients to the wider ecosystem, acts as a hub by receiving these materials in the form of dead insects, exuvia and puparia, faecal matter (from scavengers, grazers and predators) and feathers (from avian scavengers and predators). As such, CDIs contribute to landscape heterogeneity. Furthermore, CDIs are a specialised habitat for a number of flies, beetles and pioneer vegetation, which enhances biodiversity in terrestrial ecosystems.},

What happens to these cells after human host death, defined here as the thanatomicrobiome (i.e., thanatos-, Greek defn., death), is not clear. To fill the void, we examined the thanatomicrobiome of the spleen, liver, brain, heart and blood of human cadavers. These organs are thought to be devoid of microorganisms in a healthy adult host. We report that the thanatomicrobiome was highly similar among organ tissues from the same cadaver but very different among the cadavers possibly due to differences in the elapsed time since death and/or environmental factors. Isolation of microbial DNA from cadavers is known to be a challenge. We compared the effectiveness of two methods by amplifying the 16S rRNA genes and sequencing the amplicons from four cadavers. Paired comparisons revealed that the conventional DNA extraction method (bead-beating in phenol/chloroform/bead-beating followed by ethanol precipitation) yielded more 16S rRNA amplicons (28 of 30 amplicons) than a second method (repeated cycles of heating/cooling followed by centrifugation to remove cellular debris) (19 of 30 amplicons). Shannon diversity index of the 16S rRNA genes revealed no significant difference by extraction method. The present report provides a proof of principle that the thanatomicrobiome may be an efficient biomarker to study postmortem transformations of cadavers.},

	abstract = {The processes associated with cadaver decomposition in outdoor settings, particularly those that occur during the extended postmortem interval ({\textgreater}30 days) are poorly understood. Thus, few methods are currently available to accurately estimate the extended postmortem interval (PMI). Of these methods, a soils-based approach has the potential to address the postmortem interval between which entomology and anthropology are the most valuable. Although the validity of soil-based methods has previously been established, little work has been conducted to explain the processes that have been designated for forensic application. As a consequence, we investigated the dynamics of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus-based compounds in soil beneath pig (Sus scrofa) cadavers (gravesoil) that were placed on the soil surface over a period of 100 days. Decomposition was assessed through the physical characteristics of the cadaver, soil pH, soil moisture content, and the concentration of total carbon, total nitrogen, soil-extractable phosphorus, and lipid-phosphorus in soil. Cadaver decomposition did not result in a significant difference in soil carbon and moisture content. However, significant (P{\textless}0.05) increases were observed in the concentration of soil pH, total nitrogen, soil-extractable phosphorus, and lipid-phosphorus. Based on the current results, a significant increase in the concentration of gravesoil nutrients represented a maximum PMI of 43 days (lipid-P), 72 days (total nitrogen), or 100 days (soil-extractable phosphorus). This work provides further evidence that a soil-based method has the potential to act as a tool for the estimation of extended PMI.},

Seven nude subjects (two black males, a white female and four white males) were placed within a decay research facility at various times of the year and allowed to decompose naturally. Data were amassed every three days in the spring and summer, and weekly in the fall and winter. Analyses of the data reveal distinct patterns in the soil solution for volatile fatty acids during soft tissue decomposition and for specific anions and cations once skeletonized, when based on accumulated degree days. Decompositional rates were also obtained, providing valuable information for estimating the "maximum time since death." Melanin concentrations observed in soil solution during this study also yields information directed at discerning racial affinities.

	abstract = {Decomposing vertebrate cadavers release large, localized inputs of nutrients. These temporally limited resource patches affect nutrient cycling and soil organisms. The impact of decomposing cadavers on soil chemistry is relevant to soil biology, as a natural disturbance, and forensic science, to estimate the postmortem interval. However, cadaver impacts on soils are rarely studied, making it difficult to identify common patterns. We investigated the effects of decomposing pig cadavers (Sus scrofa domesticus) on soil chemistry (pH, ammonium, nitrate, nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium and carbon) over a one-year period in a spruce-dominant forest. Four treatments were applied, each with five replicates: two treatments including pig cadavers (placed on the ground and hung one metre above ground) and two controls (bare soil and bags filled with soil placed on the ground i.e. "fake pig" treatment). In the first two months (15-59 days after the start of the experiment), cadavers caused significant increases of ammonium, nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium (p {\textless} 0.05) whereas nitrate significantly increased towards the end of the study (263-367 days; p {\textless} 0.05). Soil pH increased significantly at first and then decreased significantly at the end of the experiment. After one year, some markers returned to basal levels (i.e. not significantly different from control plots), whereas others were still significantly different. Based on these response patterns and in comparison with previous studies, we define three categories of chemical markers that may have the potential to date the time since death: early peak markers (EPM), late peak markers (LPM) and late decrease markers (LDM). The marker categories will enhance our understanding of soil processes and can be highly useful when changes in soil chemistry are related to changes in the composition of soil organism communities. For actual casework further studies and more data are necessary to refine the marker categories along a more precise timeline and to develop a method that can be used in court. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, the effects of precipitation changes and nitrogen enrichment on their diversity and community composition remain poorly understood. We conducted a field experiment over 2 years with multi-level precipitation and nitrogen addition in a desert shrubland of northern China, to examine the responses of soil bacteria and fungi in terms of diversity and community composition and to explore the roles of plant and soil factors in structuring microbial communities. Water addition significantly increased soil bacterial diversity and altered the community composition by increasing the relative abundances of stress-tolerant (dormant) taxa (e.g., Acidobacteria and Planctomycetes); however, nitrogen addition had no substantial effects. Increased precipitation and nitrogen did not impact soil fungal diversity, but significantly shifted the fungal community composition. Specifically, water addition reduced the relative abundances of drought-tolerant taxa (e.g., the orders Pezizales, Verrucariales, and Agaricales), whereas nitrogen enrichment decreased those of oligotrophic taxa (e.g., the orders Agaricales and Sordariales). Shifts in microbial community composition under water and nitrogen addition occurred primarily through changing resource availability rather than plant community. Our results suggest that water and nitrogen addition affected desert microbes in different ways, with watering shifting stress-tolerant traits and fertilization altering copiotrophic/oligotrophic traits of the microbial communities. These findings highlight the importance of resource availability in driving the desert microbial responses to short-term environmental changes.},

Understanding the drivers of microbial community stability, including resistance (insensitivity to disturbance) and resilience (the rate of recovery after disturbance) is important for predicting community response to disturbance. Here, we provide an overview of the concepts of stability that are relevant for microbial communities. First, we highlight insights from ecology that are useful for defining and measuring stability. To determine whether general disturbance responses exist for microbial communities, we next examine representative studies from the literature that investigated community responses to press (long-term) and pulse (short-term) disturbances in a variety of habitats. Then we discuss the biological features of individual microorganisms, of microbial populations, and of microbial communities that may govern overall community stability. We conclude with thoughts about the unique insights that systems perspectives - informed by meta-omics data - may provide about microbial community stability.},

	doi = {doi:10.1128/mSphere.00191-21},
	abstract = {16S rRNA gene sequencing has engendered significant interest in studying microbial communities. There has been tension between trying to classify 16S rRNA gene sequences to increasingly lower taxonomic levels and the reality that those levels were defined using more sequence and physiological information than is available from a fragment of the 16S rRNA gene. Amplicon sequencing variants (ASVs) have been proposed as an alternative to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) for analyzing microbial communities. ASVs have grown in popularity, in part because of a desire to reflect a more refined level of taxonomy since they do not cluster sequences based on a distance-based threshold. However, ASVs and the use of overly narrow thresholds to identify OTUs increase the risk of splitting a single genome into separate clusters. To assess this risk, I analyzed the intragenomic variation of 16S rRNA genes from the bacterial genomes represented in an rrn copy number database, which contained 20,427 genomes from 5,972 species. As the number of copies of the 16S rRNA gene increased in a genome, the number of ASVs also increased. There was an average of 0.58 ASVs per copy of the 16S rRNA gene for full-length 16S rRNA genes. It was necessary to use a distance threshold of 5.25\% to cluster full-length ASVs from the same genome into a single OTU with 95\% confidence for genomes with 7 copies of the 16S rRNA, such as Escherichia coli. This research highlights the risk of splitting a single bacterial genome into separate clusters when ASVs are used to analyze 16S rRNA gene sequence data. Although there is also a risk of clustering ASVs from different species into the same OTU when using broad distance thresholds, these risks are of less concern than artificially splitting a genome into separate ASVs and OTUs. IMPORTANCE 16S rRNA gene sequencing has engendered significant interest in studying microbial communities. There has been tension between trying to classify 16S rRNA gene sequences to increasingly lower taxonomic levels and the reality that those levels were defined using more sequence and physiological information than is available from a fragment of the 16S rRNA gene. Furthermore, the naming of bacterial taxa reflects the biases of those who name them. One motivation for the recent push to adopt ASVs in place of OTUs in microbial community analyses is to allow researchers to perform their analyses at the finest possible level that reflects species-level taxonomy. The current research is significant because it quantifies the risk of artificially splitting bacterial genomes into separate clusters. Far from providing a better representation of bacterial taxonomy and biology, the ASV approach can lead to conflicting inferences about the ecology of different ASVs from the same genome.},

How carrion may affect soil microbial biodiversity and ecosystem processes in natural systems is comparatively unknown, but important for the intersection of vertebrate food webs, belowground processes, and ecological heterogeneity. 2. We assessed in situ soil and plant responses to wolf-killed mammal carrion in Yellowstone National Park, USA. 3. Bison and elk carcasses increased soil respiration and vegetation nutrient concentration and altered bacterial and fungal communities on carcass compared to control plots. The ?fingerprints? of soil microbial taxa associated with bison compared to elk carcasses differed considerably and taxa found depended upon abiotic gradients and soil properties. 4. We found evidence that soil microbial community changes associated with carcasses may not be as generalizable as previously thought, which is important for a mechanistic understanding of the links between carrion and soil heterogeneity and potentially for applications in forensic science. 5. This work demonstrates the importance of carrion studies in natural systems. Our findings show that carrion creates distinct ecological patterns that contribute to both above- and belowground biological heterogeneity, linking carrion distribution dynamics with soil microbial biodiversity and ecosystem functions.},

A challenge in understanding the effects of salinity on soil microbial communities is the fact that it can be difficult to disentangle the effects of salinity from those of other variables that may co-vary with salinity. Here we use a trait-based approach to identify direct effects of salinity on soil bacterial communities across two salinity gradients. Through dose–response relationships between salinity and bacterial growth, we quantified distributions of the trait salt tolerance within the communities. Community salt tolerance was closely correlated with soil salinity, indicating a strong filtering effect of salinity on the bacterial communities. Accompanying the increases in salt tolerance were consistent shifts in bacterial community composition. We identified specific bacterial taxa that increased in relative abundances with community salt tolerance, which could be used as bioindicators for high community salt tolerance. A strong filtering effect was also observed for pH across the gradients, with pH tolerance of bacterial communities correlated to soil pH. We propose phenotypic trait distributions aggregated at the community level as a useful approach to study the role of environmental factors as filters of microbial community composition.},

Although several studies have characterised changes in soil chemistry occurring under carcasses, many ecological studies have occurred over extended post-mortem intervals and fine-scale temporal changes in physicochemical conditions are poorly understood. We examined changes in a suite of soil physicochemical properties occurring under decomposing rabbit carcasses during summer in a grassland ecosystem. We found that carcasses lost over 90\% of their starting mass and reached dry decay and skeletonization after 20 days of decomposition. Carcass temperatures were up to 15 °C higher than ambient temperatures during the active decay stage (days 3 and 5) of decomposition. Soil moisture also increased by day 4, and this was matched with a simultaneous increase in total nitrogen and ammonium, as well increases in pH and electrical conductivity. Whereas these measures remained relatively stable as decay progressed, we found total phosphorus and phosphate continued to increase to day 20. The contrasting dynamics of N and P reflect the initial nutrient and fluid input during the rapid decay of soft tissues and intense activity of fly larvae, and the subsequent dry decay and exposure of skeletal components. Our study provides new information about the fine-scale timing of nutrient inputs and moisture and temperature changes occurring at the carcass/soil interface.},

The inevitable end point for all living hosts, death, has its own altered microbiome configurations.

Here we reveal distinct postmortem microbiomes of human hosts from a large-scale survey of death cases representing a predominantly urban population, and demonstrated these microbiomes reflected antemortem health conditions within 24-48 hours of death. Our results characterized microbial community structure and predicted function from 188 cases representing a cross-section of an industrial-urban population. We found strong niche differentiation of anatomic habitat and microbial community turnover based on topographical distribution. Microbial community stability was documented up to two days after death. Additionally, we observed a positive relationship between cell motility and time since host death. Interestingly, we discovered evidence that microbial biodiversity is a predictor of antemortem host health condition (e.g., heart disease). These findings improve the understanding of postmortem host microbiota dynamics, and provide a robust dataset to test the postmortem microbiome as a tool for assessing health conditions in living populations.},

Here, we discuss the necrobiome, or community of organisms associated with the decomposition of remains, specifically, the "epinecrotic" bacterial community succession throughout decomposition of vertebrate carrion. Pyrosequencing was used to (1) detect and identify bacterial community abundance patterns that described discrete time points of the decomposition process and (2) identify bacterial taxa important for estimating physiological time, a time-temperature metric that is often commensurate with minimum post-mortem interval estimates, via thermal summation models. There were significant bacterial community structure differences in taxon richness and relative abundance patterns through the decomposition process at both phylum and family taxonomic classification levels. We found a significant negative linear relationship for overall phylum and family taxon richness as decomposition progressed. Additionally, we developed a statistical model using high throughput sequencing data of epinecrotic bacterial communities on vertebrate remains that explained 94.4 \% of the time since placement of remains in the field, which was within 2-3 h of death. These bacteria taxa are potentially useful for estimating the minimum post-mortem interval. Lastly, we provide a new framework and standard operating procedure of how this novel approach of using high throughput metagenomic sequencing has remarkable potential as a new forensic tool.

We found the popular primer pair 515F (515F-C) and 806R greatly underestimated (e.g. SAR11) or overestimated (e.g. Gammaproteobacteria) common marine taxa. We evaluated marine samples and mock communities (containing 11 or 27 marine 16S clones), showing alternative primers 515F-Y (5?-GTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA) and 926R (5?-CCGYCAATTYMTTTRAGTTT) yield more accurate estimates of mock community abundances, produce longer amplicons that can differentiate taxa unresolvable with 515F-C/806R, and amplify eukaryotic 18S rRNA. Mock communities amplified with 515F-Y/926R yielded closer observed community composition versus expected (r2?=?0.95) compared with 515F-Y/806R (r2???0.5). Unexpectedly, biases with 515F-Y/806R against SAR11 in field samples (?4?10-fold) were stronger than in mock communities (?2-fold). Correcting a mismatch to Thaumarchaea in the 515F-C increased their apparent abundance in field samples, but not as much as using 926R rather than 806R. With plankton samples rich in eukaryotic DNA ({\textgreater}?1??m size fraction), 18S sequences averaged ?17\% of all sequences. A single mismatch can strongly bias amplification, but even perfectly matched primers can exhibit preferential amplification.

Initial significant changes in gravesoil chemistry occurred following approximately 320 accumulated degree days, regardless of season. Furthermore, significant (p {\textless} 0.05) correlations were observed between ammonium and pH (positive correlation) and between nitrate and pH (negative correlation).

	abstract = {Microbes have potential to be used as physical evidence for forensic science because they are ubiquitous and have predictable ecologies. With the advent of next generation sequencing technology and the subsequent boost to microbiome science (study of the genes and molecules of microbial communities), it has become possible to develop new microbial-based tools for forensic science. One promising approach is the use of microbial succession during the ecological process of decomposition to estimate the time since death, or postmortem interval (PMI). This microbial clock of death is developed by building a regression model using microbiome data collected from postmortem samples (e.g. swab of skin) with known PMIs. In a death investigation, a similar sample type (e.g. swab of skin) would be collected, the microbes profiled using DNA sequencing, and the microbes would be matched to a point on the clock (i.e. the regression model). Recent research by several independent scientific teams has provided a proof of concept for this new microbiome forensic tool. However, developing and transitioning new forensic science technologies into the justice system requires overcoming scientific, investigative, and legal hurdles. In this article, I address the apparent knowledge gaps in the science of microbiome technology to estimate PMI, and discuss a path for bringing this technology into the justice system.},

	abstract = {Background The analysis of microbial communities through DNA sequencing brings many challenges: the integration of different types of data with methods from ecology, genetics, phylogenetics, multivariate statistics, visualization and testing. With the increased breadth of experimental designs now being pursued, project-specific statistical analyses are often needed, and these analyses are often difficult (or impossible) for peer researchers to independently reproduce. The vast majority of the requisite tools for performing these analyses reproducibly are already implemented in R and its extensions (packages), but with limited support for high throughput microbiome census data. Results Here we describe a software project, phyloseq, dedicated to the object-oriented representation and analysis of microbiome census data in R. It supports importing data from a variety of common formats, as well as many analysis techniques. These include calibration, filtering, subsetting, agglomeration, multi-table comparisons, diversity analysis, parallelized Fast UniFrac, ordination methods, and production of publication-quality graphics; all in a manner that is easy to document, share, and modify. We show how to apply functions from other R packages to phyloseq-represented data, illustrating the availability of a large number of open source analysis techniques. We discuss the use of phyloseq with tools for reproducible research, a practice common in other fields but still rare in the analysis of highly parallel microbiome census data. We have made available all of the materials necessary to completely reproduce the analysis and figures included in this article, an example of best practices for reproducible research. Conclusions The phyloseq project for R is a new open-source software package, freely available on the web from both GitHub and Bioconductor.},

	abstract = {Microorganisms are key decomposers of vertebrate mortalities, breaking down body tissues and impacting decomposition progress. During human decomposition, both extrinsic environmental factors and intrinsic cadaver-related factors have the potential to impact microbial decomposers either directly or indirectly via altered physical or chemical conditions. While extrinsic factors (e.g., temperature, humidity) explain some variation in microbial response during human decomposition in terrestrial settings, recent work has noted that even under the same environmental conditions, individuals can have different decomposition patterns, highlighting the potential for intrinsic factors to impact microbial decomposers. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of several intrinsic factors (age, sex, diseases at time of death, and body mass index [BMI]) on chemical and microbial changes in decomposition-impacted soils. In a field study conducted at the University of Tennessee Anthropology Research Facility, soils were collected from the decomposition-impacted area surrounding 19 deceased human individuals through the end of active decomposition. Soil physicochemical parameters were measured, and microbial (bacterial and fungal) communities were assessed via amplicon sequencing. BMI was shown to explain some variation in soil pH and microbial response to human decomposition. Hierarchical linear mixed (HLM) effects models revealed that BMI category significantly explained variation in pH response within decomposition-impacted soils over time (HLM F = 9.647; P {\textless} 0.001). Additionally, the relative abundance of soil Saccharomycetes in decomposition soils under underweight donors displayed little to no changes (mean maximum change in relative abundance, +6.6\%), while all other BMI categories displayed an increased relative abundance of these organisms over time (normal, +50.6\%; overweight, +64.4\%; and obese, +64.6\%) (HLM F = 3.441; P = 0.11). Together, these results reveal intrinsic factors influencing decomposition patterns, especially within the soil environment, and suggest BMI is an important factor for controlling decomposition processes. IMPORTANCE This work begins to address questions about interindividual variation in vertebrate decomposition attributed to intrinsic factors, that is, properties of the carcass or cadaver itself. Most research on factors affecting decomposition has focused on the extrinsic environment, such as temperature or humidity. While these extrinsic factors do explain some variation in decomposition patterns, interindividual variability is still observed. Understanding how intrinsic factors influence microbial decomposers will help reveal the ecological impacts of decomposition. This work also has forensic applications, as soil chemical and biological changes have been suggested as indicators of postmortem interval. We reveal factors that explain variation in the decomposition environment that should be considered in these estimates. This is particularly important as we consider the implications of variations in human populations due to diet, age, BMI, disease, toxicological loading, etc. on forensic investigations dealing with decomposing remains.},

	abstract = {Carrion decomposition is a critical component of the biogeochemical cycling of energy and nutrients within the biosphere. Two important and currently overlooked nitrogen (N) pools likely to be affected by carrion are free amino acid (FAA) and peptide pools, which are a newly recognised point of competition between plants and microorganisms for the N resource. A carcass addition experiment was established using recently ({\textless}12 h) deceased kangaroo (Macropus giganteus) carcasses to quantify soil nutrient changes in a box gum grassy woodland ecosystem. Soil samples were taken every 12 weeks, and analysed for available nutrient content and FAA and peptide turnover rates. Carcasses were a source of N, adding an average of 4.4 kg m−2 to the soils directly under the decomposing carcasses in our study, representing a significant redistribution of this resource within the ecosystem. There was also a significant and lasting input of proteins (40 mg/kg) and amino acids (25 mg/kg) into the soil, which increased microbial turnover of these labile N compounds. Dissolved organic N (DON) cycling in rangelands and natural ecosystems is an overlooked part of the N and C cycle despite representing the most important nutrient input into these systems. Based on our results, we argue for a re-think on the removal of carcasses as an ecosystem management tool, as they provide large and lasting resource islands which influence soil N cycling.},

Yet little is known about the source and diversity of the thanatomicrobiome or the underlying factors leading to delayed decomposition exhibited by reproductive organs. The use of the V4 hypervariable region of bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences for taxonomic classification ("barcoding") and phylogenetic analyses of human postmortem microbiota has recently emerged as a possible tool in forensic microbiology. The goal of this study was to apply a 16S rRNA barcoding approach to investigate variation among different organs, as well as the extent to which microbial associations among different body organs in human cadavers can be used to predict forensically important determinations, such as cause and time of death. We assessed microbiota of organ tissues including brain, heart, liver, spleen, prostate, and uterus collected at autopsy from criminal casework of 40 Italian cadavers with times of death ranging from 24 to 432 h. Both the uterus and prostate had a significantly higher alpha diversity compared to other anatomical sites, and exhibited a significantly different microbial community composition from non-reproductive organs, which we found to be dominated by the bacterial orders MLE1-12, Saprospirales, and Burkholderiales. In contrast, reproductive organs were dominated by Clostridiales, Lactobacillales, and showed a marked decrease in relative abundance of MLE1-12. These results provide insight into the observation that the uterus and prostate are the last internal organs to decay during human decomposition. We conclude that distinct community profiles of reproductive versus non-reproductive organs may help guide the application of forensic microbiology tools to investigations of human cadavers.},

Microscopy-based analyses showed significantly shorter fungal hyphal lengths in the early-seral control plots in comparison with the native control plots (P\&lt;0.0003), independent of nitrogen addition. Although diversity indices did not show significant differences between the plots, SSCP analyses indicated that fungal community structure differed in the native and early-seral control sites. In nitrogen-amended sites, gene sequences from dominant haplotypes indicated a shift to a more common nitrogen-impacted fungal community. While nitrogen amendments appear to be more important than cultivation in influencing these soil fungal communities, hyphal lengths were only decreased due to cultivation.

Research of such behaviour enhances the understanding of decomposition and benefits estimating the postmortem interval (PMI) in forensic investigations, which is critical but faces multiple challenges. In this study, we combined microbial community characterization, microbiome sequencing from different organs (i.e. brain, heart and cecum) and machine learning algorithms [random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN)] to investigate microbial succession pattern during corpse decomposition and estimate PMI in a mouse corpse system. Microbial communities exhibited significant differences between the death point and advanced decay stages. Enterococcus faecalis, Anaerosalibacter bizertensis, Lactobacillus reuteri, and so forth were identified as the most informative species in the decomposition process. Furthermore, the ANN model combined with the postmortem microbial data set from the cecum, which was the best combination among all candidates, yielded a mean absolute error of 1.5 +/- 0.8 h within 24-h decomposition and 14.5 +/- 4.4 h within 15-day decomposition.

However, our understanding of the specific changes in soil bacterial community structure that occur across larger spatial scales is limited because most previous work has focused on either surveying a relatively small number of soils in detail or analyzing a larger number of soils with techniques that provide little detail about the phylogenetic structure of the bacterial communities. Here we used a bar-coded pyrosequencing technique to characterize bacterial communities in 88 soils from across North and South America, obtaining an average of 1,501 sequences per soil. We found that overall bacterial community composition, as measured by pairwise UniFrac distances, was significantly correlated with differences in soil pH (r = 0.79), largely driven by changes in the relative abundances of Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes across the range of soil pHs. In addition, soil pH explains a significant portion of the variability associated with observed changes in the phylogenetic structure within each dominant lineage. The overall phylogenetic diversity of the bacterial communities was also correlated with soil pH (R(2) = 0.50), with peak diversity in soils with near-neutral pHs. Together, these results suggest that the structure of soil bacterial communities is predictable, to some degree, across larger spatial scales, and the effect of soil pH on bacterial community composition is evident at even relatively coarse levels of taxonomic resolution.},

Zopfiaceae and Delitchiaceae did group together, but without significant support. Eremodothis angulata (currently in Testudinaceae) is closely related to Westerdykella in Sporormiaceae. Phaeotrichaceae and Venturiaceae formed a group with strong BS support on a branch outside Pleosporales, but an alternative topology including Phaeotrichaceae and Venturiaceae within Pleosporales could not be rejected.

However, the impacts of subsurface human decomposition, where oxygen becomes limited and microbial biomass is generally lower, are far less understood. The goals of this study were to evaluate the impact of human decomposition in a multi-individual, shallow ({\textasciitilde}70 cm depth) grave on soil biogeochemistry and soil microbial and nematode communities. Three individuals were interred and allowed to decay for four years. Soils were collected from two depths (0‒5 and 30‒35 cm) along linear transects radiating from the grave as well as from within and below (85‒90 cm depth) the grave during excavation to assess how decomposition affects soil properties. Along radiating surface transects, several extracellular enzymes rates and nematode richness increased with increasing distance from the grave, and likely reflect physical site disruption due to grave excavation and infill. There was no evidence of carcass-sourced C and N lateral migration from the grave, at least at 30‒35 cm depth. Within the grave, soils exhibited significant N-enrichment (e.g., ammonium, dissolved organic N), elevated electrical conductivity, and elevated respiration rates with depth. Soil biogeochemistry within the grave, particularly in the middle (30‒35 cm) and base (70‒75 cm depth), was significantly altered by human decomposition. Mean microbial gene abundances changed with depth in the grave, demonstrating increased microbial presence in response to ongoing decomposition. Human-associated Bacteroides were only detected at the base of the grave where anoxic conditions prevailed. Nematode community abundance and richness were reduced at 70‒75 cm and not detectable below 85‒90 cm. Further, we identified certain Plectus spp. as potential indicators of enrichment due to decomposition. Here we demonstrate that human decomposition influences soil biogeochemistry, microbes, and microfauna up to four years after burial.},

	abstract = {Research on the human microbiome, the microbiota that live in, on, and around the human person, has revolutionized our understanding of the complex interactions between microbial life and human health and disease. The microbiome may also provide a valuable tool in forensic death investigations by helping to reveal the postmortem interval (PMI) of a decedent that is discovered after an unknown amount of time since death. Current methods of estimating PMI for cadavers discovered in uncontrolled, unstudied environments have substantial limitations, some of which may be overcome through the use of microbial indicators. In this project, we sampled the microbiomes of decomposing human cadavers, focusing on the skin microbiota found in the nasal and ear canals. We then developed several models of statistical regression to establish an algorithm for predicting the PMI of microbial samples. We found that the complete data set, rather than a curated list of indicator species, was preferred for training the regressor. We further found that genus and family, rather than species, are the most informative taxonomic levels. Finally, we developed a k-nearest- neighbor regressor, tuned with the entire data set from all nasal and ear samples, that predicts the PMI of unknown samples with an average error of +/-55 accumulated degree days (ADD). This study outlines a machine learning approach for the use of necrobiome data in the prediction of the PMI and thereby provides a successful proof-of- concept that skin microbiota is a promising tool in forensic death investigations.},

Nulligravid human uteri and prostate glands are the last internal organs to deteriorate during decomposition; however, the reason for this very important observation is still enigmatic. Recent studies have elucidated that the composition and abundance of microbes in the human thanatomicrobiome (microbiome of death) varies by organ and changes as a function of time and temperature. The ileocecal area has the largest absolute postmortem burden that spreads to the liver and spleen and continues to the heart and brain depending on the cause of death. To truly understand the mechanisms of microbial assembly during decomposition, a thorough examination of different strategies utilized by the trillions of microbes that colonize decaying tissues is needed from a multi-organ and multidisciplinary approach. In this review, we highlight interdisciplinary research and provide an overview of human decomposition investigations of thanatomicrobiomic changes in internal organs.},

We performed phylogenetic surveys of thanatomicrobiome signatures of cadavers' internal organs to compare the microbial diversity between the 16S rRNA gene V4 hypervariable region and V3-4 conjoined regions from livers and spleens of 45 cadavers undergoing forensic microbiological studies. Phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that the V4 region had a significantly higher mean Chao1 richness within the total microbiome data. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance statistical tests, based on unweighted UniFrac distances, demonstrated that taxa compositions were significantly different between V4 and V3-4 hypervariable regions (p {\textless} 0.001). Of note, we present the first study, using the largest cohort of criminal cases to date, that two hypervariable regions show discriminatory power for human postmortem microbial diversity. In conclusion, here we propose the impact of hypervariable region selection for the 16S rRNA gene in differentiating thanatomicrobiomic profiles to provide empirical data to explain a unique concept, the Postmortem Clostridium Effect.},

Forensic microbiologists are developing new applications to investigate the dynamic and coordinated changes in microbial activity that occur when a human host dies. There is currently a paucity of explorations of the thanatomicrobiome (thanatos-, Greek for death) and epinecrotic communities (microbial communities residing in and/or moving on the surface of decomposing remains). Ongoing studies can help clarify the structure and function of these postmortem microbiomes. Human microbiome studies have revealed that 75–90\% of cells in the body prior to death are microbial. Upon death, putrefaction occurs and is a complicated process encompassing chemical degradation and autolysis of cells. Decomposition also involves the release of contents of the intestines due to enzymes under the effects of abiotic and biotic factors. These factors likely have predictable effects on postmortem microbial communities and can be leveraged for forensic studies. This mini review provides a critical examination of emerging research relating to thanatomicrobiome and epinecrotic communities, how each is studied, and possible strategies of stochastic processes.},

Although largely attributed to microbial metabolism, very little is known about the bacterial basis of human decomposition. To assess the change in bacterial community structure through time, bacterial samples were collected from several sites across two cadavers placed outdoors to decompose and analyzed through 454 pyrosequencing and analysis of variable regions 3-5 of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene. Each cadaver was characterized by a change in bacterial community structure for all sites sampled as time, and decomposition, progressed. Bacteria community structure is variable at placement and before purge for all body sites. At bloat and purge and until tissues began to dehydrate or were removed, bacteria associated with flies, such as Ignatzschineria and Wohlfahrtimonas, were common. After dehydration and skeletonization, bacteria associated with soil, such as Acinetobacter, were common at most body sites sampled. However, more cadavers sampled through multiple seasons are necessary to assess major trends in bacterial succession.},

Soil core-samples (grave-soil) were taken underneath the carcass every three days until day 15, and then sampled on days 28, 43, 57, and 71 between September and December 2008. Results indicated that lipolytic bacterial counts were initially the lowest at day 0 (before exposure) and increased to their highest between days 9 and 12 (active decomposition): they then decreased and leveled at days 15 through 71. Conversely, the proteolytic bacterial counts initially were the highest at day 0, slowly decreased at days 3 (fresh) and 6 (bloat) with a rapid decline at day 9 (active) followed by a second major decline at day 28 (advanced); they then leveled through the remaining time period.

There remains extensive debate on the best way to bin and approximate this taxonomy. Here we examine two popular approaches using a large field-based data set examining both bacteria and fungi and conclude that there are not major differences in the ecological outcomes. Thus, it appears that standard microbial community analyses are not overly sensitive to the particulars of binning approaches. Recent discussion focuses on the best method for delineating microbial taxa, based on either exact sequence variants (ESVs) or traditional operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of marker gene sequences. We sought to test if the binning approach (ESVs versus 97\% OTUs) affected the ecological conclusions of a large field study. The data set included sequences targeting all bacteria (16S rRNA) and fungi (internal transcribed spacer [ITS]), across multiple environments diverging markedly in abiotic conditions, over three collection times. Despite quantitative differences in microbial richness, we found that all α and β diversity metrics were highly positively correlated (r \&gt; 0.90) between samples analyzed with both approaches. Moreover, the community composition of the dominant taxa did not vary between approaches. Consequently, statistical inferences were nearly indistinguishable. Furthermore, ESVs only moderately increased the genetic resolution of fungal and bacterial diversity (1.3 and 2.1 times OTU richness, respectively). We conclude that for broadscale (e.g., all bacteria or all fungi) α and β diversity analyses, ESV or OTU methods will often reveal similar ecological results. Thus, while there are good reasons to employ ESVs, we need not question the validity of results based on OTUs.

	abstract = {Advances in nucleic acid sequencing technology have enabled expansion of our ability to profile microbial diversity. These large datasets of taxonomic and functional diversity are key to better understanding microbial ecology. Machine learning has proven to be a useful approach for analyzing microbial community data and making predictions about outcomes including human and environmental health. Machine learning applied to microbial community profiles has been used to predict disease states in human health, environmental quality and presence of contamination in the environment, and as trace evidence in forensics. Machine learning has appeal as a powerful tool that can provide deep insights into microbial communities and identify patterns in microbial community data. However, often machine learning models can be used as black boxes to predict a specific outcome, with little understanding of how the models arrived at predictions. Complex machine learning algorithms often may value higher accuracy and performance at the sacrifice of interpretability. In order to leverage machine learning into more translational research related to the microbiome and strengthen our ability to extract meaningful biological information, it is important for models to be interpretable. Here we review current trends in machine learning applications in microbial ecology as well as some of the important challenges and opportunities for more broad application of machine learning to understanding microbial communities.},

	abstract = {The necrobiome is the postmortem community that includes bacteria, fungi, arthropods, and other cadaver-associated organisms. It has been suggested as biological evidence for forensic investigation. Fungi form distinctive mildew spots in colonizing decomposing bodies, converting them into moldy cadavers. However, the postmortem fungal community consists of more than these visible species. Characterizing the succession pattern of the fungal community during decomposition is valuable not only for understanding the ecosystem composition of the cadaver decomposition islands but also for contributing to forensic investigations. In the present study, the fungal composition of pig cadavers and succession patterns during decomposition were investigated with high-throughput sequencing. The succession patterns were easier to discern in outdoor cadavers, compared with those that were placed indoors. The metabarcoding approach revealed trends linking particular fungal taxa with specific postmortem intervals (PMIs). Dominant species increased notably in cadavers and soil. Furthermore, the succession of the soil community was driven by the cadaver decomposition. Significant mycoflora differences were observed between environmental and cadaveric soil. The results obtained suggested that postputrefaction mycoflora have considerable potential for PMI estimation, particularly in cases that involve heavily decomposed bodies. In addition, the diversity of fungal communities revealed by the metabarcoding approach allowed us to discriminate the sites of cadaver decomposition, implying that postputrefaction mycoflora may be helpful in identifying the environment in which a cadaver has been placed, or the original location from which a cadaver has been moved. Our results provide an important step towards developing fungal evidence for use in forensic science and add to the growing body of work on postmortem microbial communities.},

	abstract = {Although researchers have begun cataloging the incredible diversity of bacteria found in soil, we are largely unable to interpret this information in an ecological context, including which groups of bacteria are most abundant in different soils and why. With this study, we examined how the abundances of major soil bacterial phyla correspond to the biotic and abiotic characteristics of the soil environment to determine if they can be divided into ecologically meaningful categories. To do this, we collected 71 unique soil samples from a wide range of ecosystems across North America and looked for relationships between soil properties and the relative abundances of six dominant bacterial phyla (Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, alpha-Proteobacteria, and the beta-Proteobacteria). Of the soil properties measured, net carbon (C) mineralization rate (an index of C availability) was the best predictor of phylum-level abundances. There was a negative correlation between Acidobacteria abundance and C mineralization rates (r2 = 0.26, P {\textless} 0.001), while the abundances of beta-Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were positively correlated with C mineralization rates (r2 = 0.35, P {\textless} 0.001 and r2 = 0.34, P {\textless} 0.001, respectively). These patterns were explored further using both experimental and meta-analytical approaches. We amended soil cores from a specific site with varying levels of sucrose over a 12-month period to maintain a gradient of elevated C availabilities. This experiment confirmed our survey results: there was a negative relationship between C amendment level and the abundance of Acidobacteria (r2 = 0.42, P {\textless} 0.01) and a positive relationship for both Bacteroidetes and beta-Proteobacteria (r2 = 0.38 and 0.70, respectively; P {\textless} 0.01 for each). Further support for a relationship between the relative abundances of these bacterial phyla and C availability was garnered from an analysis of published bacterial clone libraries from bulk and rhizosphere soils. Together our survey, experimental, and meta-analytical results suggest that certain bacterial phyla can be differentiated into copiotrophic and oligotrophic categories that correspond to the r- and K-selected categories used to describe the ecological attributes of plants and animals. By applying the copiotroph-oligotroph concept to soil microorganisms we can make specific predictions about the ecological attributes of various bacterial taxa and better understand the structure and function of soil bacterial communities.},

	abstract = {Soil samples from the Forensic Anthropology Research Facility (FARF) at Texas State University, San Marcos, TX, were analyzed for multiple soil characteristics from cadaver decomposition islands to a depth of 5centimeters (cm) from 63 human decomposition sites, as well as depths up to 15cm in a subset of 11 of the cadaver decomposition islands plus control soils. Postmortem interval (PMI) of the cadaver decomposition islands ranged from 6 to 1752 days. Some soil chemistry, including nitrate-N (NO3-N), ammonium-N (NH4-N), and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), peaked at early PMI values and their concentrations at 0–5cm returned to near control values over time likely due to translocation down the soil profile. Other soil chemistry, including dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), orthophosphate-P (PO4-P), sodium (Na+), and potassium (K+), remained higher than the control soil up to a PMI of 1752days postmortem. The body mass index (BMI) of the cadaver appeared to have some effect on the cadaver decomposition island chemistry. To estimate PMI using soil chemistry, backward, stepwise multiple regression analysis was used with PMI as the dependent variable and soil chemistry, body mass index (BMI) and physical soil characteristics such as saturated hydraulic conductivity as independent variables. Measures of soil parameters derived from predator and microbial mediated decomposition of human remains shows promise in estimating PMI to within 365days for a period up to nearly five years. This persistent change in soil chemistry extends the ability to estimate PMI beyond the traditionally utilized methods of entomology and taphonomy in support of medical-legal investigations, humanitarian recovery efforts, and criminal and civil cases.},

The oral cavity harbors one of the most diverse microbiomes that play a key role in the decomposition of corpses. In this study, the oral bacterial community showed obvious changes in relative abundance during the process of mice decomposition. Meanwhile, at different taxonomic levels, specific bacteria were found to be significantly correlated with the postmortem interval. Linear regression models between relative abundance and the postmortem interval were constructed. Among these species, Gamma-proteobacteria and Proteus were the best ones that can be used to infer the postmortem interval, especially late postmortem interval. Therefore, we suggest that succession of oral microbial community can be developed as a forensic tool for estimating the postmortem interval.},

	abstract = {Vertebrate decomposition processes have important ecological implications and, in the case of human decomposition, forensic applications. Animals, especially domestic pigs (Sus scrofa), are frequently used as human analogs in forensic decomposition studies. However, recent research shows that humans and pigs do not necessarily decompose in the same manner, with differences in decomposition rates, patterns, and scavenging. The objective of our study was to extend these observations and determine if human and pig decomposition in terrestrial settings have different local impacts on soil biogeochemistry and microbial activity. In two seasonal trials (summer and winter), we simultaneously placed replicate human donors and pig carcasses on the soil surface and allowed them to decompose. In both human and pig decomposition-impacted soils, we observed elevated microbial respiration, protease activity, and ammonium, indicative of enhanced microbial ammonification and limited nitrification in soil during soft tissue decomposition. Soil respiration was comparable between summer and winter, indicating similar microbial activity; however, the magnitude of the pulse of decomposition products was greater in the summer. Using untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics approaches, we identified 38 metabolites and 54 lipids that were elevated in both human and pig decomposition-impacted soils. The most frequently detected metabolites were anthranilate, creatine, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, taurine, xanthine, N-acetylglutamine, acetyllysine, and sedoheptulose 1/7-phosphate; the most frequently detected lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine and monogalactosyldiacylglycerol. Decomposition soils were also significantly enriched in metabolites belonging to amino acid metabolic pathways and the TCA cycle. Comparing humans and pigs, we noted several differences in soil biogeochemical responses. Soils under humans decreased in pH as decomposition progressed, while under pigs, soil pH increased. Additionally, under pigs we observed significantly higher ammonium and protease activities compared to humans. We identified several metabolites that were elevated in human decomposition soil compared to pig decomposition soil, including 2-oxo-4-methylthiobutanoate, sn-glycerol 3-phosphate, and tryptophan, suggesting different decomposition chemistries and timing between the two species. Together, our work shows that human and pig decomposition differ in terms of their impacts on soil biogeochemistry and microbial decomposer activities, adding to our understanding of decomposition ecology and informing the use of non-human models in forensic research.},

The Total Body Score (TBS) method was applied to quantify decomposition changes and calculate the postmortem interval (PMI) in accumulated degree days (ADD). Decomposition trajectories were analyzed by comparing the estimated and actual ADD for each seasonal trial and by fuzzy cluster analysis. The cluster analysis demonstrated that the rabbits formed one group while pigs and humans, although more similar to each other than either to rabbits, still showed important differences in decomposition patterns.

We compared the respective influences of two widely used methods, namely DADA2 (a denoising method) vs. Mothur (a clustering method) on 16S rRNA gene amplicon datasets (hypervariable region v4), and compared such effects to the rarefaction of the community table and OTU identity threshold (97\% vs. 99\%) on the ecological signals detected. We used a dataset comprising freshwater invertebrate (three Unionidae species) gut and environmental (sediment, seston) communities sampled in six rivers in the southeastern USA. We ranked the respective effects of each methodological choice on alpha and beta diversity, and taxonomic composition. The choice of the pipeline significantly influenced alpha and beta diversities and changed the ecological signal detected, especially on presence/absence indices such as the richness index and unweighted Unifrac. Interestingly, the discrepancy between OTU and ASV-based diversity metrics could be attenuated by the use of rarefaction. The identification of major classes and genera also revealed significant discrepancies across pipelines. Compared to the pipeline’s effect, OTU threshold and rarefaction had a minimal impact on all measurements.},

However, the developmental time as reported by these studies varies greatly, and current more detailed data is needed for use in medicocriminal entomology. Hourly developmental data is presented under constant temperatures of 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40°C, and cyclic temperatures of 10–15, 15–25, 25–35 and 35–45°C.

	abstract = {Microbes in soils and other environments produce extracellular enzymes to depolymerize and hydrolyze organic macromolecules so that they can be assimilated for energy and nutrients. Measuring soil microbial enzyme activity is crucial in understanding soil ecosystem functional dynamics. The general concept of the fluorescence enzyme assay is that synthetic C-, N-, or P-rich substrates bound with a fluorescent dye are added to soil samples. When intact, the labeled substrates do not fluoresce. Enzyme activity is measured as the increase in fluorescence as the fluorescent dyes are cleaved from their substrates, which allows them to fluoresce. Enzyme measurements can be expressed in units of molarity or activity. To perform this assay, soil slurries are prepared by combining soil with a pH buffer. The pH buffer (typically a 50 mM sodium acetate or 50 mM Tris buffer), is chosen for the buffer's particular acid dissociation constant (pKa) to best match the soil sample pH. The soil slurries are inoculated with a nonlimiting amount of fluorescently labeled (i.e. C-, N-, or P-rich) substrate. Using soil slurries in the assay serves to minimize limitations on enzyme and substrate diffusion. Therefore, this assay controls for differences in substrate limitation, diffusion rates, and soil pH conditions; thus detecting potential enzyme activity rates as a function of the difference in enzyme concentrations (per sample). Fluorescence enzyme assays are typically more sensitive than spectrophotometric (i.e. colorimetric) assays, but can suffer from interference caused by impurities and the instability of many fluorescent compounds when exposed to light; so caution is required when handling fluorescent substrates. Likewise, this method only assesses potential enzyme activities under laboratory conditions when substrates are not limiting. Caution should be used when interpreting the data representing cross-site comparisons with differing temperatures or soil types, as in situ soil type and temperature can influence enzyme kinetics.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have revealed distinct thanatomicrobiome (microbiome of death) signatures in human body sites after death. Thanatomicrobiome studies suggest that microbial succession after death may have the potential to reveal important postmortem biomarkers for the identification of time of death. We surveyed the postmortem microbiomes of cardiac tissues from 10 corpses with varying times of death (6-58 h) using amplicon-based sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene' V1-2 and V4 hypervariable regions. The results demonstrated that amplicons had statistically significant (P {\textless} 0.05) sex-dependent changes. Clostridium sp., Pseudomonas sp., Pantoea sp. and Streptococcus sp. had the highest enrichment for both V1-2 and V4 regions. Interestingly, the results also show that V4 amplicons had higher abundance of Clostridium sp. and Pseudomonas sp. in female hearts compared to males. In addition, Streptococcus sp. was solely found in male heart samples. The distinction between sexes was further supported by principle coordinate analysis, which revealed microbes in female hearts formed a distinctive cluster separate from male cadavers for both hypervariable regions. This study provides data that demonstrates that two hypervariable regions show discriminatory power for sex differences in postmortem heart samples. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The findings represent preliminary data of the first thanatomicrobiome investigation of a comparison between 16S rRNA gene V1-2 and V4 amplicon signatures in corpse heart tissues. The results demonstrated that V4 hypervariable region amplicons had statistically significant (P {\textless} 0.05) sex-dependent microbial diversity. For example, Streptococcus sp. was solely found in male postmortem heart tissues. Interestingly, the results also show that V4 amplicons had higher abundance of Clostridium sp. and Pseudomonas sp. in female heart tissues compared to males. The finding of Clostridium sp. supports the postmortem clostridium effect in corpse heart tissues.},

The postmortem interval can lead to the identification of the deceased and the validation of witness statements and suspect alibis. Recent research has demonstrated that microbes provide an accurate clock that starts at death and relies on ecological change in the microbial communities that normally inhabit a body and its surrounding environment. Here, we explore how to build the most robust Random Forest regression models for prediction of PMI by testing models built on different sample types (gravesoil, skin of the torso, skin of the head), gene markers (16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), 18S rRNA, internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS)), and taxonomic levels (sequence variants, species, genus, etc.). We also tested whether particular suites of indicator microbes were informative across different datasets. Generally, results indicate that the most accurate models for predicting PMI were built using gravesoil and skin data using the 16S rRNA genetic marker at the taxonomic level of phyla. Additionally, several phyla consistently contributed highly to model accuracy and may be candidate indicators of PMI.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: High-throughput sequencing of small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) genes from marine environments is a widely applied method used to uncover the composition of microbial communities. We conducted an analysis of surface ocean waters with the commonly employed hypervariable 4 region SSU rRNA gene primers 515F and 806R, and found that bacteria belonging to the SAR11 clade of \textit{Alphaproteobacteria}, a group typically making up 20 to 40\% of the bacterioplankton in this environment, were greatly underrepresented and comprised {\textless}4\% of the total community. Using the SILVA reference database, we found a single nucleotide mismatch to nearly all SAR11 subclades, and revised the 806R primer so that it increased the detection of SAR11 clade sequences in the database from 2.6 to 96.7\%. We then compared the performance of the original and revised 806R primers in surface seawater samples, and found that SAR11 comprised 0.3 to 3.9\% of sequences with the original primers and 17.5 to 30.5\% of the sequences with the revised 806R primer. Furthermore, an investigation of seawater obtained from aquaria revealed that SAR11 sequences acquired with the revised 806R primer were more similar to natural cellular abundances of SAR11 detected using fluorescence \textit{in situ} hybridization counts. Collectively, these results demonstrate that a minor adjustment to the 806R primer will greatly increase detection of the globally abundant SAR11 clade in marine and lake environments, and enable inclusion of this important bacterial lineage in experimental and environmental-based studies.},

The two bodies had accumulated degree days (ADD) of 5799 and 5469 and post mortem interval (PMI) of 288 and 248d, respectively. The spatial extent for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and organic nitrogen (DON) for both bodies was large but similar suggesting some movement off site for both compounds. Mean DOC was 1087+/-727 and 1484+/-1236mugg(-1) dry soil under the two corpses relative to 150+/-68mugg(-1) in upslope control soils. Sulfate tended to have 'hot spots' of lower values relative to the control soils indicative of anaerobic respiration. pH was lower and electrical conductivity was higher in the soil under both decomposing cadavers relative to control soils. Some of the nutrients examined downslope of the human remains were significantly higher than control soils upslope suggesting movement of decomposition products off-site which could be an important factor when using human remains detector dogs.},

	abstract = {Over the past several decades, there have been several strident exchanges regarding whether forensic entomologists estimate the postmortem interval (PMI), minimum PMI, or something else. During that time, there has been a proliferation of terminology reflecting this concern regarding “what we do.” This has been a frustrating conversation for some in the community because much of this debate appears to be centered on what assumptions are acknowledged directly and which are embedded within a list of assumptions (or ignored altogether) in the literature and in case reports. An additional component of the conversation centers on a concern that moving away from the use of certain terminology like PMI acknowledges limitations and problems that would make the application of entomology appear less useful in court—a problem for lawyers, but one that should not be problematic for scientists in the forensic entomology community, as uncertainty is part of science that should and can be presented effectively in the courtroom (e.g., population genetic concepts in forensics). Unfortunately, a consequence of the way this conversation is conducted is that even as all involved in the debate acknowledge the concerns of their colleagues, parties continue to talk past one another advocating their preferred terminology. Progress will not be made until the community recognizes that all of the terms under consideration take the form of null hypothesis statements and that thinking about “what we do” as a null hypothesis has useful legal and scientific ramifications that transcend arguments over the usage of preferred terminology.},

	abstract = {Vertebrate decomposition results in an ephemeral disturbance of the surrounding environment. Microbial decomposers are recognized as key players in the breakdown of complex organic compounds, controlling carbon and nutrient fate in the ecosystem and potentially serving as indicators of time since death for forensic applications. As a result, there has been increasing attention on documenting the microbial communities associated with vertebrate decomposition, or the ‘necrobiome’. These necrobiome studies differ in the vertebrate species, microhabitats (e.g. skin vs. soil), and geographic locations studied, but many are narrowly focused on the forensic application of microbial data, missing the larger opportunity to understand the ecology of these communities. To further our understanding of microbial dynamics during vertebrate decomposition and identify knowledge gaps, there is a need to assess the current works from an ecological systems perspective. In this review, we examine recent work pertaining to microbial community dynamics and succession during vertebrate (human and other mammals) decomposition in terrestrial ecosystems, through the lens of a microbial succession ecological framework. From this perspective, we describe three major microbial microhabitats (internal, external, and soil) in terms of their unique successional trajectories and identify three major knowledge gaps that remain to be addressed.},

Significant (p {\textless} 0.05) increases in ninhydrin-reactive nitrogen, pH, total nitrogen, and nitrate in gravesoil were detected 1 year postmortem. Significant differences in gravesoil chemistry were not detected 3 years postmortem. These observations coincided with gaps in plant growth 1 year postmortem and the development of lush vegetation 3 years postmortem. We conclude that these phenomena can be used to assist the decision-making process regarding the allocation of resources during the early stages of a death investigation.},

	abstract = {Understanding the microbes that colonize and degrade bone has important implications for preservation of skeletal elements and identification of unknown human remains. Current research on the postmortem bone microbiome is limited and largely focuses on archaeological or marine contexts. Bones and teeth can provide a lasting resource to identify human remains following decomposition. Bone can support dynamic communities of micro- and macroscopic scavengers and incidental taxa, which influence the preservation of bone over time. Previously we identified key microbial taxa associated with survivability of DNA in bones of surface-decomposed human remains, observing high intra- and interindividual variation. Here we characterized the postmortem bone microbiome of skeletal remains in a multi-individual burial to better understand subsurface bone colonization and preservation. To understand microbial community origins and assembly, 16S rRNA amplicon sequences from 256 bone and 27 soil samples were compared to bone from individuals who decomposed on the ground surface, and human gut sequences from the American Gut Project. Untargeted metabolomics was applied to a subset of 41 bone samples from buried remains to examine potential microbe–metabolite interactions and infer differences related to community functionality. Results show that postmortem bone microbial communities are distinct from those of the oxic surface soils and the human gut. Microbial communities from surface-deposited bone and shallow buried bone were more similar to those from soils, while bones recovered from saturated areas deeper in the grave showed increased similarity with human gut samples with higher representation of anaerobic taxa, suggesting that the depositional environment affected the established bone microbiome. Correlations between metabolites and microbes indicate that phosphate solubilization is likely an important mechanism of microbially mediated skeletal degradation. This research expands our knowledge of microbial bone colonizers, including colonizers important in a burial environment. IMPORTANCE Understanding the microbes that colonize and degrade bone has important implications for preservation of skeletal elements and identification of unknown human remains. Current research on the postmortem bone microbiome is limited and largely focuses on archaeological or marine contexts. Our research expands our understanding of bone microbiomes in buried remains by characterizing the taxonomic and metabolic diversity of microbes that are colonizing bone after a 4-year postmortem burial interval and examines the potential impact of microbial colonization on human skeletal DNA preservation. Our results indicate that the postmortem bone microbiome is distinct from the human gut and soil. Evidence from combined metabolomic and amplicon sequencing analysis suggests that Pseudomonas and phosphate solubilization likely play a role in skeletal degradation. This work provides important insight into the types and activities of microbes controlling the preservation of buried skeletal remains.},

However, the dynamics of the coalesced microbial communities, and the relative contributions of environment- and carcass-derived microbes to C and N cycling are unknown. To test whether environment-derived, carcass-derived, or the combined microbial communities exhibited a greater influence on C and N cycling, we conducted controlled laboratory experiments that combined carcass decomposition fluids and soils to simulate carcass decomposition hotspots. We selectively sterilized the decomposition fluid and/or soil to remove microbial communities and create different combinations of environment- and carcass-derived communities and incubated the treatments under three temperatures (10, 20, and 30 °C).},

	abstract = {Mammalian decomposition provides pulses of organic matter to the local ecosystem creating ephemeral hotspots of nutrient cycling. While changes to soil biogeochemistry in these hotspots have been described for C and N, patterns associated with deposition and cycling of other elements have not received the same attention. The goal of our study was to evaluate temporal changes to a broad suite of dissolved elements in soils impacted by human decomposition on the soil surface including: 1) abundant mineral elements in the human body (K, Na, S, P, Ca, and Mg), 2) trace elements in the human body (Fe, Mn, Se, Zn, Cu, Co, and B), and 3) Al which is transient in the human body but common in soils. We performed a four-month human decomposition trial at the University of Tennessee Anthropology Research Facility and quantified elemental concentrations dissolved in the soil solution, targeting the mobile and bioavailable fraction. We identified three groups of elements based on their temporal patterns. Group 1 elements appeared to be cadaver-derived (Na, K, P, S) and their persistence in soil varied based upon soluble organic forms (P), the dynamics of the soil exchange complex (Na, K), and gradual releases attributable to microbial degradation (S). Group 2 elements (Ca, Mg, Mn, Se, B) included three elements that have greater concentrations in soil than would be expected based on cadaver inputs alone, suggesting that these elements partially originate from the soil exchange (Ca, Mg), or are solubilized as a result of soil acidification (Mn). Group 3 elements (Fe, Cu, Zn, Co, Al) increased late in the decomposition process, suggesting a gradual solubilization from soil minerals under acidic pH conditions. This work presents a detailed longitudinal characterization of changes in dissolved soil elements during human decomposition furthering our understanding of elemental deposition and cycling in these environments.},

We generated a metagenome-assembled genome library from cadaver-associated soils and integrated it with metabolomics data to identify links between taxonomy and function. This universal network of microbial decomposers is characterized by cross-feeding to metabolize labile decomposition products. The key bacterial and fungal decomposers are rare across non-decomposition environments and appear unique to the breakdown of terrestrial decaying flesh, including humans, swine, mice and cattle, with insects as likely important vectors for dispersal. The observed lockstep of microbial interactions further underlies a robust microbial forensic tool with the potential to aid predictions of the time since death.},

	abstract = {Human decomposition in terrestrial ecosystems is a dynamic process creating localized hot spots of soil microbial activity. Longer-term (beyond a few months) impacts on decomposer microbial communities are poorly characterized and do not typically connect microbial communities to biogeochemistry, limiting our understanding of decomposer communities and their functions. We performed separate year-long human decomposition trials, one starting in spring, another in winter, integrating bacterial and fungal community structure and abundances with soil physicochemistry and biogeochemistry to identify key drivers of microbial community change. In both trials, soil acidification, elevated microbial respiration, and reduced soil oxygen concentrations occurred. Changes in soil oxygen concentrations were the primary driver of microbial succession and nitrogen transformation patterns, while fungal community diversity and abundance was related to soil pH. Relative abundance of facultative anaerobic taxa (Firmicutes and Saccharomycetes) increased during the period of reduced soil oxygen. The magnitude and timing of the decomposition responses were amplified during the spring trial relative to the winter, even when corrected for thermal inputs (accumulated degree days). Further, soil chemical parameters, microbial community structure, and fungal gene abundances remained altered at the end of 1 year, suggesting longer-term impacts on soil ecosystems beyond the initial pulse of decomposition products.},
